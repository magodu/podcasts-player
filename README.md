# Podcasts player app

This project has a SPA application to hear podcasts coded in React v18. There are 2 execution modes: development and production mode. 

## How to install

Git and a package manager shuch as npm should ne installed first.

### Clone repo

In a terminal move to the chosen directory to allocate the project and execute `git clone git@github.com:magodu/podcasts-player.git`

### Install dependencies

Move to chosen directory and install its dependencies with the command `npm install`.

## Application running

Once all dependencies are installed you can run the project in two modes:

### Development mode

Assets are not minified. Execute in a terminal `npm start` in the project folder.


### Production mode

Assets are minified and concatenated. Execute in a terminal `npm build` in the project folder.
This command uilds the app for production to the `build` folder. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
